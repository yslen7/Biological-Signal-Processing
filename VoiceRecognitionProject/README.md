The program recognizes four phrases in Spanish (Buenos días, Buenas noches, ¿Cómo estás? and ¿Dónde estás?) said by 4 people with an accuracy of 81.25%.
When an audio is selected from the database, the program recognizes which person says the phrase and which phrase is. The result is shown with an image of the person, a written phrase and an audio of the system replying to the phrase.
A GUI was designed as a graphical interface to a speech recognition system using AppDesigner in MATLAB (the code is in file named as App and PF.mlapp). 
A Multilayer Perceptron with backpropagation algorithm is proposed to classify between the phrases and each person (MLPBackpropagation), using the analysis of frequency (Freq.m) and an Energy in the Zerocrossing Intervals pattern (EnergyCalculation.m).
